# Employee Management System

This project is a Java-based application that allows users to manage employee records in a database. It provides a user-friendly console interface to perform the following operations:

    1. Add a New Employee: Collect employee details (name, age, gender, date of birth, position, and department) and store them in a MySQL database.
    2 Update Existing Employee: Modify specific employee details based on their unique ID.
    3. Delete an Employee: Remove an employee's record from the database using their ID.
    4. View Employee Details: Fetch and display either all employee records or the details of a specific employee.

The application uses JDBC for database connectivity and ensures dynamic SQL query execution using prepared statements for security and efficiency. It is a simple yet robust project for demonstrating database interaction and CRUD operations in Java.
